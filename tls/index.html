        <h1>TLS: The Nuclear Option</h1>
        <p class="lead">
          Transport Layer Security (TLS), previously known as the Secure
          Sockets Layer (SSL), has been the de-facto solution for transport
          encryption on the Internet for quite some time. Is it time for a
          change?
        </p>
        <img src="/img/ripley.jpg">

        <h2>Is Change Possible?</h2>
        <p>
          TLS has succeeded in becoming the universal transport encryption
          protocol universally supported across multiple different operating
          systems, language environments, and programs throughout the Internet.
        </p>
        <p>
          If TLS has been such a success, why should we change? Is there a real,
          legitimate need to start over from scratch, re-evaluate our principles,
          and come up with a better plan in every regard to the protocol's design,
          or should we try to fix TLS instead, identifying problems in the
          protocol's design, attempting to fix them, and publishing new versions
          of TLS with the changes?
        </p>
        <p>
          If we're starting over, where do we stop? Is TLS flawed as a protocol?
          What about X.509 certificates? Do those need to be replaced to?
          Do we need ASN.1 to die in a fire? Should we try to start over fresh and
          <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/1403_02-08_mickens.pdf">
            wash it all away?
          </a>
        </p>
        <p>
          We ask you to, for a brief moment, suspend any disbelief that TLS is
          irreplacable and try to imagine a future where everyone's TCP sessions
          are encrypted with a protocol better than TLS which uses a certificate
          format better than X.509, a format that's simple, human readable, and
          describable via a context-free grammar. We know we're talking ponies
          and unicorns here, but is that really so bad?

        <h2>The Status Quo</h2>
        Transport Layer Security is presently the foremost method of encryption used
        on the Internet today, with multiple different implementations by different
        vendors:
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>OpenSSL:</b> The most popular TLS implementation, maintained by
              Google security boffins Ben Laurie and Adam Langley who are doing
              some pretty top notch work salvaging it. Widely regarded by the security
              community as an enormous steaming pile of poo with a byzantine API
              and surrealist implementation. Just got popped by
              <a href="http://heartbleed.com">Heartbleed</a>, a trivial coding error
              which has now been demonstrated to leak private keys. Previously been
              subject to even worse bugs, like a
              <a href="https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0162.html"> 
                remote code execution
              </a> vulnerability.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>NSS:</b> The original transport encryption library which dates all
              the way back to Netscape. Widely regarded by the security community as
              an enormous stinking pile of poo with a byzantine API and surrealist
              implementation. Was popped last year by a
              <a href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/rhsa-announce/2013-December/msg00026.html">
                remote code execution
              </a> vulnerability.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>GnuTLS:</b> An alternative TLS library created by the GNU project.
              Makes some moderate improvements in the space of TLS APIs, by decoupling
              encryption from the I/O layer. Was recently popped by a
              <a href="http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/65919">
                certificate validation bug
              </a>
              and in 2008 was vulnerable to a
              <a href="https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2008-1948">
                remote code execution
              </a> vulnerability.
            </li>
          </ul>
