        <h1>TLS: The Nuclear Option</h1>
        <p class="lead">
          Transport Layer Security (TLS), previously known as the Secure
          Sockets Layer (SSL), has been the de-facto solution for transport
          encryption on the Internet for quite some time. Is it time for a
          change?
        </p>

      <div class="container">
        <h2>Is Change Possible?</h2>
        <p>
          TLS has succeeded in becoming the universal transport encryption
          protocol universally supported across multiple different operating
          systems, language environments, and programs throughout the Internet.
        </p>
        <p>
          If TLS has been such a success, why should we change? Is there a real,
          legitimate need to start over from scratch, re-evaluate our principles,
          and come up with a better plan in every regard to the protocol's design,
          or should we try to fix TLS instead, identifying problems in the
          protocol's design, attempting to fix them, and publishing new versions
          of TLS with the changes?
        </p>
        <p>
          If we're starting over, where do we stop? Is TLS flawed as a protocol?
          What about X.509 certificates? Do those need to be replaced too?
          Do we need ASN.1 to die in a fire? Should we try to start over fresh and
          <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/1403_02-08_mickens.pdf">
            wash it all away?
          </a>
        </p>
        <p>
          We ask you to, for a brief moment, suspend any disbelief that TLS is
          irreplacable and try to imagine a future where everyone's TCP sessions
          are encrypted with a protocol better than TLS which uses a certificate
          format better than X.509, a format that's simple, human readable, and
          describable via a context-free grammar. We know we're talking ponies
          and unicorns here, but is that really so bad?

        <h2>The Status Quo</h2>
        Transport Layer Security is presently the foremost method of encryption used
        on the Internet today, with multiple different implementations by different
        vendors:
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>OpenSSL:</b> The most popular TLS implementation, maintained by
              Google security boffins Ben Laurie and Adam Langley who are doing
              some pretty top notch work salvaging it. Widely regarded by the security
              community as an enormous steaming pile of poo with a byzantine API
              and surrealist implementation. Just got popped by
              <a href="http://heartbleed.com">Heartbleed</a>, a trivial coding error
              which has now been
              <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2014/04/11/heartbleed-openssl-cloudflare-challenge/">
                shown to leak private keys.
              </a>
              Previously subject to even worse bugs, like a
              <a href="https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0162.html"> 
                remote code execution
              </a> vulnerability.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>NSS:</b> The original transport encryption library which dates all
              the way back to Netscape, used by Firefox. Widely regarded by the security
              community as an enormous stinking pile of poo with a byzantine API and
              surrealist implementation. Was popped in 2013 by a
              <a href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/rhsa-announce/2013-December/msg00026.html">
                remote code execution
              </a> vulnerability.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>GnuTLS:</b> An alternative TLS library created by the GNU project.
              Makes some moderate improvements in the space of TLS APIs, by decoupling
              encryption from the I/O layer. Was recently popped by a
              <a href="http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/65919">
                certificate validation bug
              </a>
              and in 2008 was vulnerable to a
              <a href="https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2008-1948">
                remote code execution
              </a> vulnerability.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Heartbleed has received an awful lot of attention recently, described by
          a certain prominent security researcher as
          <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/04/heartbleed.html">
            11 on a scale from 1 to 10.
          </a>
          Yet if we look back, we actually find worse vulnerabilities both in OpenSSL
          and other major TLS implementations. We also find patterns of confusing
          APIs, confusion around return values, and overall poor code quality. Here
          is an example from the OpenSSL codebase:
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/master/ssl/ssl_lib.c#L1054">
            https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/master/ssl/ssl_lib.c#L1054
          </a>
          <pre>
            int SSL_shutdown(SSL *s)
                    {
                    /* Note that this function behaves differently from what one might
                     * expect.  Return values are 0 for no success (yet),
                     * 1 for success; but calling it once is usually not enough,
                     * even if blocking I/O is used (see ssl3_shutdown).
                     */
         </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          A similarly confusing API was implicated in the
          <a href="https://www.gitorious.org/gnutls/gnutls/commit/6aa26f78150ccbdf0aec1878a41c17c41d358a3b">
            recent GnuTLS certificate validation bug
          </a> which was reminiscient of Apple's recent
          <a href="https://gotofail.com/">goto fail</a> bug for bypassing TLS certificate validation.
        </p>

          The status quo does not instill confidence about the future security of the Internet.
          We can also observe some common themes about the cause of the problems:
        </p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Lack of memory safety:</b> cause the remote code execution bugs prevalent throughout TLS
              stacks and the recent Heartbleed bugs
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Confusing conventions:</b> when language conventions like returning 0 or -1 vs 1 or 0 to
              indicate success or failure are used simultaneously, programmers can become confused as to
              whether given operations are succeeding or failing, which has lead to bugs in practice.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Confusing code:</b> The <i>goto fail</i> bug was caused by confusing language syntax,
              namely the lack of braces in an if statement. Ideally this shouldn't be possible.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          We can note similar problems with the X.509 certificate format, which was was designed without
          a proper understanding of the
          <a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~sergey/langsec/">
            security applications of formal language theory
          </a>
          making the format difficult to work with:
        </p>
        <p class="callout">
          <a href="http://langsec.org/occupy/">
            <img src="/img/weirdmachines.jpg">
          </a>
        </p>
        <p>
          The complexities of the X.509 certificate format were recently illustrated by a paper on
          <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~shmat/shmat_oak14.pdf">Frankencerts</a>, certificates
          automatically assembled from fragments of other TLS certificates which exposed a number of
          bugs in TLS certificate validation implementations across multiple stacks.
        </p>
        <p>
          We could continue to embrace TLS and X.509, and create a new TLS implementation in a memory
          safe systems programming like <a href="http://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>, however this
          overlooks the fact that TLS is <i>black fucking magic</i> and producing a new, interoperable
          TLS implementation is an absurdly difficult undertaking.
        </p>
        <p>
          Last, but not least, we might bring up the fact that "Transport Layer Encryption" doesn't
          work on the OSI transport layer (layer 4), but in fact works on the session layer (layer 5)
          and presentation layer (layer 6). Despite the fact SSL was renamed to TLS, when they did
          the renaming they even got that wrong. TLS is <i>wrong at every level</i>.

        <h2>Sketches of a Better Future</h2>
        <p>
          Designing a new transport encryption protocol from scratch is an absurdly difficult undertaking.
          It's possibly the hardest type of cryptographic protocol to design, and many attempts by amateurs
          to design such a protocol immediately fall victim to a number of attacks, like replay attacks,
          timing attacks, and various other information oracles like padding oracles. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's say we want to throw the baby out with the bathwater in regard to TLS, but don't want to
          start completely from scratch when designing a next generation transport encryption protocol.
          Where should we look?
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="http://curvecp.org/">CurveCP</a>, designed by Daniel J. Bernstein (djb), provides a glimpse
          into the future of transport protocols, as does the more recent
          <a href="http://cr.yp.to/tcpip/minimalt-20130522.pdf">MinimaLT</a>. These protocols provide encrypted
          transport atop the UDP protocol, in hopes of defeating <a href="http://curvecp.org/availability.html">
          attacks on TCP's availability, by using things like RST packets.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, the modern Internet does not look favorably upon UDP.
          <a href="http://www.delaat.net/rp/2010-2011/p48/report.pdf">
            Preliminary benchmarks of CurveCP showed nearly complete packet loss in the face of TCP congestion
          </a>
          which is arguably a problem with
          <a href="http://curvecp.org/decongestion.html">
            CurveCP's decongestion algorithm
          </a>
          but much more likely an intractable problem with trying to do bulk transfers with UDP.
          While djb has his heart in the right place, his vision of a DoS-proof UDP-based transport
          encryption protocol probably isn't a particularly practical one on the modern Internet.
          It's our argument that a TLS replacement should likely be a TCP session encryption
          protocol much like TLS itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some work on encrypting TCP sessions directly is being developed by the
          <a href="http://tcpcrypt.org/">Tcpcrypt</a> group, however they're developing tools for
          <i>opportunistic encryption</i> which is not resilient to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.
          A proper TCP replacement should make effors to ensure that you have the right key for
          the person or site that you intend to be talking to.
        </p>
